<!-- DECISION FORMATS

## Quick Format (Y-Statement)

For lightweight decisions, a single statement suffices:

> "In the context of [situation], facing [constraint], we decided for [choice]
> and against [alternatives], to achieve [benefit], accepting that [trade-off]."

## Full Format

For significant decisions:

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Decision Title

**Status**: Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated

**Context**: What situation prompted this decision? What constraints exist?

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Option A: [Pros] / [Cons]
- Option B: [Pros] / [Cons]

**Decision**: What was decided?

**Rationale**: Why this choice over the alternatives?

**Consequences**: What are the implications? (Include both positive and negative)

**Related**: See also [other decision] | Supersedes [old decision]

## When to Record a Decision

✓ Trade-offs between alternatives
✓ Non-obvious design choices
✓ Choices that affect architecture
✓ "Why" that needs preservation

✗ Minor implementation details
✗ Routine maintenance
✗ Configuration changes
✗ No real alternatives existed
