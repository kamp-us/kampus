# Spellbook Generator Progress

## Completed
- [x] FR-0.1: Set up bun test with initial test files
- [x] FR-1.1: CLI accepts `kampus generate spellbook <feature-name>` command
- [x] FR-1.2: Feature name validated as kebab-case
- [x] FR-1.3: Duplicate feature detection (package/worker folder exists)

## Phase 1: Command Wiring
- [x] Create generate parent command
- [x] Create spellbook command stub
- [x] Wire generate into kampus-effect.tsx
- [ ] Add jsonc-parser dependency
- [x] Verify `kampus generate spellbook --help` works

## Phase 2: Types, Naming & Validation
- [x] Create shared types (Column, Naming, GeneratorOptions)
- [x] Implement deriveNaming function
- [x] Implement validateFeatureName (kebab-case check)
- [x] Implement checkFeatureExists
- [x] Add tests for naming utils

## Notes
- Removed alias support (`g` for `generate`) - only one way to invoke commands
- FR-1.2 (alias) removed from requirements, renumbered subsequent items

## 2026-01-17: Kebab-case Validation (FR-1.2)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/cli/generators/spellbook/types.ts` (new)
- `apps/cli/generators/spellbook/naming.ts` (new)
- `apps/cli/generators/spellbook/validation.ts` (new)
- `apps/cli/commands/generate/spellbook/spellbook.ts` (modified)

**Key decisions:**
- Used `Data.TaggedError` for typed errors (InvalidFeatureNameError, FeatureExistsError)
- Regex `/^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*$/` validates kebab-case
- Error handling via `Effect.catchAll` + `Match.tag` pattern

## 2026-01-17: Duplicate Feature Detection (FR-1.3)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/cli/generators/spellbook/validation.ts` (modified)
- `apps/cli/commands/generate/spellbook/spellbook.ts` (modified)

**Key decisions:**
- Added `findMonorepoRoot()` helper to locate project root from any subdirectory
- Uses `pnpm-workspace.yaml` as marker file for monorepo root
- Checks both `packages/<feature>` and `apps/worker/src/features/<feature>`
- Uses `@effect/platform` FileSystem service for file existence checks
- Error message shows relative path for clarity

## 2026-01-17: Testing Infrastructure (FR-0.1)

**Files changed:**
- `apps/cli/package.json` (added test script)
- `apps/cli/generators/spellbook/naming.test.ts` (new)
- `apps/cli/generators/spellbook/validation.test.ts` (new)

**Key decisions:**
- Used `bun test` as test runner (native to CLI runtime)
- Tests colocated with source files
- `FileSystem.layerNoop` for mocking filesystem in validation tests
- Must mock `pnpm-workspace.yaml` exists check for monorepo root detection
